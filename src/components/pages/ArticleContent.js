      `A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

      Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:
      
      Sends the task to the computer's file system.
      Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
      Returns the content to the client.
      Ready to handle the next request.

      Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
      
      Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.`,
